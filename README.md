# Assignment_SC
Scalable Computer Chat Protocol

# NOTE
My commits and changes and progress are all done in the files under Assignment_SC folder Please use them for the evaluation and grading. However for execution please use the code from Assignment_SC/ChatRoom folder as the same code code is in the proper folder wise structure for compilation and the compiled class files & configuration files are also available in the respective directory. Basically that is direct Eclipse export.

# PreRequisites
>> Java 1.8.0*

>> Probably a bash terminal to run the configuration files to execute the code

# CONFIG & EXECUTION

>> Download and Extract files of the entire ChatRoom Folder 

>> Goto ChatRoom/src/config/ open run.sh  using vi run.sh / gedit if installed and change the IP address to the required server.

>> Goto ChatRoom/src/conf/ and run ./compile.sh followed by ./run.sh. This will have started the server and the code.

>> Now using the test link connect to the same port and IP and view terminal for execution. Press Ctrl+C to quit the server
